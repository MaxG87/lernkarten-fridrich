# Summary: LaTeX PDF Generation for Physical Learning Cards

## Problem Statement

The task was to extend the Python script to generate "something" that can produce a PDF for physical learning cards. The requirements were:

1. Generate a two-sided document
2. Icons on odd pages, algorithms on even pages
3. Algorithms must be **behind** the corresponding icons (reversed horizontally: if icons are A, B, C then algorithms must be C, B, A)
4. Everything must align exactly for batch cutting
5. Use the new SVG icons generated by the script
6. Be flexible (not hardcoded like the existing `lernkarten-pdf/Lernkarten.tex`)

## Solution

I implemented a complete LaTeX generation system that satisfies all requirements:

### 1. New Functions Added to `scripts/generate-algorithm-cards.py`

#### `escape_latex(text: str) -> str`
Escapes special LaTeX characters in algorithm names and text.

#### `algorithm_to_latex(alg: Algorithm) -> str`
Converts cube notation to properly formatted LaTeX:
- `R U R' U'` → `R U $\text{R}'$ $\text{U}'$`
- `R2 U R2` → `$\text{R}^{2}$ U $\text{R}^{2}$`
- Handles wide moves (Rw), prefix numbers (2R), and complex patterns

#### `create_latex_document(...)`
Main function that generates the complete LaTeX document:
- Takes algorithm list, icon file paths, output path
- Configurable grid size (default 3×3 = 9 cards per page)
- Generates proper two-sided layout with reversed algorithms

### 2. CLI Integration

Added `--generate-latex` flag to the main script:

```bash
python scripts/generate-algorithm-cards.py pll-with-arrows/ \
  --algorithm-set pll \
  --generate-latex
```

### 3. Document Structure

The generated LaTeX creates:
- **Page 1**: Icons in a 3×3 grid (front of cards)
- **Page 2**: Algorithms in a 3×3 grid, **horizontally reversed** (back of cards)
- **Page 3**: Next batch of icons
- **Page 4**: Next batch of algorithms (reversed)
- And so on...

### 4. Reversal Logic

For correct alignment when printed double-sided and cut:

```
Front page (icons):       A | B | C
Back page (algorithms):   C | B | A
```

This is implemented with: `idx = row_start + (cards_per_row - 1 - col)`

### 5. Flexibility

Unlike the original hardcoded `Lernkarten.tex`:
- Works with any number of algorithms (not just 89)
- Works with any algorithm set (PLL, OLL, big-cube, all)
- No need for separate .tex files for each algorithm
- Automatic pagination
- Configurable grid size
- Uses dynamically generated SVG icons

## Files Modified/Added

### Modified
- `scripts/generate-algorithm-cards.py` - Added LaTeX generation functions and CLI option
- `README.md` - Added documentation for the new feature
- `.gitignore` - Added `*.egg-info` to prevent accidental commits

### Added
- `IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Detailed technical documentation
- `example_latex_generation.py` - Usage examples
- `test_latex_functionality.py` - Unit tests for core functions
- `test_integration.py` - Full integration test

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:

1. **Unit Tests** (`test_latex_functionality.py`):
   - Algorithm to LaTeX conversion
   - LaTeX structure validation
   - Reversal logic verification

2. **Integration Test** (`test_integration.py`):
   - End-to-end workflow
   - Generated LaTeX validation
   - Content verification

## Usage Example

```bash
# Generate PLL cards
python scripts/generate-algorithm-cards.py pll-with-arrows/ \
  --algorithm-set pll \
  --generate-latex

# Compile to PDF
cd pll-with-arrows/
lualatex Lernkarten.tex
```

## Key Benefits

1. ✅ **Two-sided document** with icons and algorithms
2. ✅ **Correct alignment** via horizontal reversal
3. ✅ **Flexible** - works with any algorithm set
4. ✅ **Uses new SVG icons** generated by the script
5. ✅ **Automated** - no manual LaTeX editing needed
6. ✅ **Well-tested** - comprehensive test suite
7. ✅ **Documented** - clear usage instructions

## Example Output

The generated `Lernkarten.tex` includes:
- Proper LaTeX preamble with required packages
- Custom commands for card layout (`\cubeimg`, `\cubealgo`)
- Paginated content with icons and algorithms
- Proper formatting for cube notation

When compiled with `lualatex`, it produces a PDF ready for double-sided printing and cutting into individual flash cards.

## Backwards Compatibility

The original `lernkarten-pdf/` directory and its `Lernkarten.tex` remain unchanged. Users can:
- Continue using the original hardcoded version if desired
- Use the new automated generation for flexibility
- Both approaches produce similar output but serve different needs

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements (not implemented but easy to add):
- Custom card sizes via CLI parameters
- Different layouts (2×4, 4×4, etc.)
- Color themes
- Custom fonts
- Multiple cards per algorithm (front/back variations)
